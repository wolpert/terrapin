# Terrapin

A collection of open-source tools.

## Description

The Terrapin project is a set of software projects that help provide features that can be used for a broad range
of applications. These features were used internally for **CodeHead** projects, but have been made available for
external usages. When possible, features are developed in a functional programming style, with limited side
effects.
